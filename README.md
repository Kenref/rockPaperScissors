This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game in which the objective is to get to 5 wins before the opponent.

Challenges:
1. Event listeners - using event listeners was definitely the hardest part of this project as I had only just learnt about the topic. One of the things that made it difficult to understand was the different ways which event listeners could be implemented and which style was best for the circumstance. 
2. Using JS to add classes and id's in html. Although it was not an easy concept to grasp and implement, it was difficult to use at first because it required a lot of testing in order to visualise how the page turned out since a lot of the elements couldn't be seen like they were able to in HTML.
